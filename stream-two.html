        <p>We all have way to much stuff, but what happends when we focus on the things we really need instead of the things we think we need?</p>
        <p> Do we feel suddently cluttert? Do we feel the need to get rid of stuff and to focus on the really important things</p>
        <p>Getting rid of stuff can truly halp to be able to breath again ad to feel independent and free</p>
